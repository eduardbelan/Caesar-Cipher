# Caesar Cipher

This program implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm. It allows you to encrypt or decrypt messages using either an extended alphabet (including letters, numbers, and symbols) or the normal alphabet.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the program:
```bash
python caesar-cipher.py
```
4. Follow the instructions to:
   + choose the cipher mode (encryption or decryption),
   + enter the message to encrypt/decrypt, 
   + and specify the shift amount.

5. After the encryption or decryption, you can choose to go again or exit the program.

## Versions

The program includes two versions:
- **Extended Alphabet Version**: Allows encryption and decryption using an extended alphabet, including letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Normal Alphabet Version**: Allows encryption and decryption using only the normal alphabet.

You can choose the desired version by commenting/uncommenting the corresponding function calls in the code.

Feel free to customize and modify the program according to your needs!
